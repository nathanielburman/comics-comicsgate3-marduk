Title: Jews are not worshipping who they thought they were. Marduk became God. Nebu, his son, is Jesus. Gay what?

Marduk took over Judaism and sent his son NEBU as Christ. That was the end of Judaism. Marduk already infiltrated your religion, while you were in Bablyon. What was it you said you wanted to do to homosexuals?

Marduk want to know.

All reformed Jews run the risk of worshipping Marduk. 100% Unless you say, this is not for Marduk. He got in your holy books.

What were you all doing out there in Babylon anyways? How did you get there? Who brought you to Babylon?

For what purpose?

Did they kill your god in Babylon?

Jews kill gods though right? Jews killed Jesus, the Catholics say. That is deicide.

Deicider, Deicide, Killing a God.

According to legends and scriptures. Marduk became the head of the gods in Babylon. He actually tried the Jesus Christ thing in Babylon before Isreal.

He sent son, the prophet Nebu. And Babylonians loved him. But he couldn't get to the Romans.

So he planned a new strategy. He already owned the Jews, but they were different. So he tried the Jesus thing again with the Jews.

Oh boy did he try it. He sent prophet after prophet after prophet after prophet. Finally, they took to one.

The Romans killed Jesus. The Jews said he was not their Christ, because their Christ would remove the chains of their slavery with a sword. So, they denied him and the Romans killed him.

Obviously he performed miracles inside of this simulation. But they all were essentially.

The Essenes helped pave the way for a Christ figure to appear. The Dead Sea Scrolls also support the evidence that the ideas that Jesus was talking about were already written down by other people and he was working off of the culture of the day.

They called them Gnostics, which means knowing. They know.

Is faith required?

So Jews, who do you worship? The gay god, or the heterosexual god that said some confusing things to a specific group of people?
